# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m **Ying-Hua Chung**, a bilingual engineer (Chinese & English) with a diverse background spanning telecom, computational chemistry, teaching, and now **Power Systems Engineering**.

---

## My Career Journey

After earning a Ph.D. in Chemistry with a focus on molecular simulation, I spent several years in academic research, developing software tools and running advanced computational models. I later pivoted to education, teaching high school math, physics, and college chemistry.

Today, Iâ€™m applying my analytical, simulation, and technical communication skills to the field of electric power systems. Iâ€™m especially interested in grid modeling, load flow analysis, and the tools that support clean and reliable energy systems.

## Key Highlights

- **EIT Certified** â€” #171094, Minnesota (Effective 5/21/2025)
- Completed **Electric Power Systems Online Lecture Series**, studying steady-state load flow and short circuit analysis.
- Currently developing an **IEEE 14-Bus Load Flow Simulation** using PyPSA.
- Published multiple peer-reviewed papers in computational chemistry.
- Fluent in Chinese and English; experienced working across cultures.
